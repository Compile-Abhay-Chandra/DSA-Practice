                                        Advantages of Using Linked Lists in C++:


Dynamic Size:    Linked lists can grow or shrink at runtime without predefined size requirements.

Efficient Insertions and Deletions:    Insertion and deletion are quick (𝑂(1)) as no shifting is needed, unlike arrays.

Better Memory Utilization:    Memory is allocated as needed, avoiding wasted or insufficient memory.

No Contiguous Memory Requirement:    Nodes can be stored anywhere in memory, ideal for fragmented memory systems.

Foundation for Advanced Data Structures:    Used to build stacks, queues, hash tables, graphs, and more.

No Size Limitation:    Limited only by available memory, unlike arrays which require contiguous memory.

Customizable Node Structure:    Nodes can hold different types of data or additional pointers (e.g., in doubly linked lists).

Efficient for Middle Element Operations:    No shifting of elements is needed when modifying elements in the middle.

Suitable for Frequent Insertions and Deletions:    Ideal for scenarios where data changes dynamically, like implementing queues or linked stacks.

Key Note:
    Accessing elements in a linked list is slower (𝑂(𝑛)) compared to arrays (𝑂(1)), so they are best suited for applications requiring frequent modifications rather than random access.
